> Conceptualization and vocabulary: I'd suggest you to use delayed recognition instead of sleeping beauty for scholarly rigor and precision. To describe your work, I think the term delayed recognition in co-citation
would be much clearer, or delayed recognition of co-citation linkage.

We agree with the reviewer. Delayed Recognition is far more precise as Garfield, for example, used it.  However, we did not coin this term, which has been extensively used by others and originated from van Raan.
Thus, we have used the term  when referring to prior publications. For example, the abstract of Ke et al (PNAS 2015) begins with "A Sleeping Beauty (SB) in science refers to a paper whose importance is not 
recognized for several years after publication." Similarly from Ye and Bornmann (2016) "In recent years, a number of studies have introduced methods for identifying papers with delayed recognition (so 
called "sleeping beauties", SBs) or have presented single publications as cases of SBs." There are also other papers from Ye, Bornmann, and van Raan among others that use this terminology so We have revised the
text of our manuscript, however, to make our preference clear and excise Sleeping Beauty from the discussion of our own results.

> Depth of sleep: it was mentioned long before it was defined. When you introduce concepts such as depth of sleep, length of sleep, and awakening, please provide a precise and self-contained definition or formula,
at least how many ways they can be measured in the literature and which one will be used in your study.For example, what is considered as an awakening event or measure? What are the available definitions and what
is yours in this context?

Yes, thank you. We have made corresponding revisions.

> The depth of the analysis should be deepened. For example, the Rassias article appeared in four pairs of co-cited references. It would be informative to the readers if you can elaborate what the four pairs are,
when the awakening events took place in each of the pair, what are the fields of research for these four publications, and similar questions like these.

The discussion of Banach spaces is beyond our expertise but we have attempted to flesh out our discussion of Rassias.

> There are some inconsistencies, which should be easy to correct: The number of cases: 1,196 cases vs 1,126 pairs in the abstract. Please resolve.

Yes, this seems to have been a carryover from a previous version of the manuscript. Thank you for pointing this out. It has been corrected.

> The scope of the data: you mentioned the references are from publications between 1985-1995, and prior 1970 publications were excluded, but then later you mentioned the last co-cited year (2018). If 1995 is
the most recent year of your citing articles, how can you get a co-citation in year 2018? If you used publications in addition to the 1985-1995 set, please provide a clear description.

Our apologies for not being clear enough. The targets of co-citation were the references of publications between 1985-1995. The co-citing events were measured from the first instance through 2018. Consider the
following hyopthetical example. For two  references r1 and r2 found in an article  published in 1986 could have themselves been published in 1976 and 1980. r1 and r2 could have been first co-cited in 1980 and then
co-cited multiple times to a total of say 250 by the end of 2018. We have revised the text to make this clear.

> Please provide a formula for computing beauty coefficient.

Done.


> Figure 3: Here is my suggestion: Break down the single network diagram to several ones so that each one represents a snapshot concerning the delayed recognition, for example, before the delayed recognition
in Biochemistry and after, or simply divide the network over time, i.e. the year of publication.

I don't want to do this. 

> Supplemental Data: In addition to share the identity of the 1,196 pairs in their DOIs and metadata, it would be useful if the authors can share more contextual data such as the time series of citation frequencies
and co-citation frequencies, and their corresponding Scopus ASJC Classification.

Wenxi can we do this?

> Finally, the authors should carefully proofread the paper and whenever possible use more precise and scholarly vocabularies instead of metaphorical terms, especially using them without giving formula or
precise measurements.

This point is well taken but as we explain the metaphorical term we used is not one that we coined. We hope that the revisions are clarifying. We have proofread the document and corrected some
inadvertent errors.
